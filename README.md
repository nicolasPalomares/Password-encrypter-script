# Password encrypter script
Powershell script for password encryption (or whatever text you want). The program was made in Java (JDK 23.0.1) with BCryptPasswordEncoder class. The code is inside com/example/util directory.
This script was originally made by me as a fast and simple way of encrypting passwords for my Spring applications, as I work with Spring Security.
